# Hacking Food Nutrition (Project Rachel Griffith)


This project uses the previous work on demand for food and evaluated how different types of policies can be effective and improving nutritional outcomes for the Uganda population. We analyze fortification of food and food subsidy policies and compare between subsidizing for foods that are elastic versus inelastic.

In particular, we propose a policy that will fortify specific goods. In many parts of the world, foritification of food helps correct identified nutrient deficiencies in the population, including the population of Uganda. Fortifying foods can help prevent specific deficiency disease syndromes. Some major micronutrient deficiencies in Uganda are iodine-deficiency disorders, vitamin A deficiency, and iron-deficiency anemia.
